Trying to make a console faux Amazon.

You'll need to install mysql, inquirier, and cli-table via npm installer.   If you don't know what that means, then google it.

The app doesn't currently update the quantity when a purchase is made.  Someday I'll look into the problem.


# Use
You're just supposed to type the item ID of the product you want to buy on the prompt, and it'll give you your item total if enough is in stock.  Otherwise, it'll say we don't have enough.
